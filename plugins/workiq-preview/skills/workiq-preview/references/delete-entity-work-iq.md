# delete_entity_work_iq

Delete a WorkIQ entity via HTTP DELETE. This is a permanent operation — use with care, especially for emails and calendar events.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `entityUrl` | string | Yes | The entity path including the item's ID (e.g., `/me/events/{id}`). Must be relative to the domain root — start with `/`, do not include a scheme or authority (`https://graph.microsoft.com` ❌, `/me/events/{id}` ✅). URL-encode any special characters in path segments. |

## When to Use

- Deleting a calendar event
- Deleting a draft email
- Removing a task from To Do or Planner
- Deleting a Teams message (where permitted)

## Gotchas

- **Email deletion moves to Deleted Items**, it does not permanently delete. To permanently delete, use `do_action_work_iq` with `/me/messages/{id}/permanentDelete`.
- **Calendar event deletion** removes it from the calendar and sends cancellation notices to attendees if it was an organized meeting.
- Always confirm the entity ID with `fetch_work_iq` before deleting to avoid removing the wrong item.

## Workflow

1. Use `fetch_work_iq` to confirm you have the correct entity and its ID
2. Call `delete_entity_work_iq` with the entity's full path including ID
