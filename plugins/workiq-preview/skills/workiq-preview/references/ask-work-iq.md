# ask_work_iq

Query Microsoft 365 Copilot for workplace intelligence using natural language. This is the primary tool for all M365 data questions — it grounds answers in real organizational data via Microsoft Graph.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `question` | string | Yes | A natural language question. Be specific about people, topics, or timeframes for better results. |
| `fileUrls` | string[] | No | Optional list of OneDrive or SharePoint file URLs to use as context for the question. |
| `conversationId` | string | No | Optional conversation ID from a prior `ask_work_iq` response to continue an existing conversation. |
| `agentId` | string | No | Optional agent ID to target a specific M365 Copilot agent. Defaults to bizchat. Use `list_agents` to discover available agent IDs. |

## When to Use

Use `ask_work_iq` when:
- You need information that exists somewhere in M365 (emails, meetings, documents, Teams, Calendar, people)
- The user asks about what someone said, shared, or communicated
- You need organizational context before implementing something
- Any question that could be answered by Outlook, Teams, SharePoint, OneDrive, or Calendar

Prefer `ask_work_iq` over entity tools when the question is open-ended or exploratory. Switch to entity tools when you need precise, structured data or need to write/modify data.
