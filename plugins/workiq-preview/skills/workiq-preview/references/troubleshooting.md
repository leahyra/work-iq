# Troubleshooting WorkIQ

Use this reference when a WorkIQ tool call fails, returns an unexpected error, or behaves differently than the documentation suggests. Resolve the issue here before retrying or falling back to a different approach.

## Both `workiq` and `workiq-preview` installed side-by-side

**Symptom:** Both the stable `workiq` and the `workiq-preview` plugins are installed and you're unsure which is being used, or behavior changes between sessions.

**Cause:** Both plugins can be installed simultaneously — they register different MCP server names (`workiq` and `workiq-preview`), so their tools appear under different prefixes (`workiq-*` vs `workiq-preview-*`). However, **both binaries share the same `~/.workiq` config file** regardless of which channel they came from (see "Conflicting WorkIQ binaries / versions share one config file" below).

**Fix:** It's safe to have both installed for testing purposes, but:

- Decide which one you want the model to use and prefer tools with that prefix.
- If you only need one channel, uninstall the other to remove ambiguity:

  ```powershell
  copilot plugin uninstall workiq-preview
  # …or
  copilot plugin uninstall workiq
  ```

- Be aware that config changes (auth, scopes, defaults) made by one will be seen by the other.

## Same plugin name from different marketplaces (`workiq@copilot-plugins` vs `workiq@microsoft`)

**Symptom:** Documentation, skill triggers, or guidance differ from what someone else on your team sees, even though "WorkIQ is installed" for both of you.

**Cause:** Multiple marketplaces publish a plugin called `workiq` (for example `workiq@copilot-plugins` and `workiq@microsoft`). These are **different skill packages** that all point at the same underlying MCP server (`@microsoft/workiq`). Tool behavior is identical, but skill prompts, trigger phrases, and references may differ.

**Fix:** Check exactly which package is installed:

```powershell
copilot plugin list
```

If the wrong one is installed, uninstall it and install the intended one by its fully qualified name:

```powershell
copilot plugin uninstall workiq
copilot plugin install workiq@microsoft
```

## Conflicting WorkIQ binaries / versions share one config file

**Symptom:** Config changes made with one `workiq` binary appear to be lost, ignored, or unexpectedly applied when a different `workiq` is invoked. Common after switching between a globally-installed `workiq` and the `npx`-on-demand binary used by the MCP server, or between stable and preview versions.

**Cause:** All WorkIQ binaries — regardless of how they are installed (`npm i -g`, `npx -y @microsoft/workiq`, the MCP server's own `npx` invocation, stable vs. preview) — read and write the **same config file** under the user's home directory. A newer or older binary can mutate config in ways that break other versions.

**Fix:**

1. Decide which channel (stable or preview) you want to use, and uninstall the others (see the "Multiple WorkIQ plugins installed" section above).
2. If you have a globally installed `workiq` (`npm ls -g @microsoft/workiq`), make sure its version matches the one the MCP server runs (`@latest` for stable, `@preview` for preview).
3. If config looks corrupted or out of sync, reset it and re-consent:

   ```powershell
   workiq config list
   # Inspect, then if needed:
   workiq config reset
   workiq auth consent --scopes <scopes you need>
   ```

## Tool name not found

**Symptom:** A call to `ask_work_iq`, `fetch_work_iq`, etc. fails with "tool does not exist" or similar.

**Cause:** Your MCP host exposes the tool under a prefixed name derived from the **MCP server name** (`workiq-preview`), not the logical name documented in the skill.

**Fix:** Scan your available-tools list for an entry whose name **ends with** the logical name (e.g., `ask_work_iq`). In Copilot CLI the prefixed form is `workiq-preview-ask_work_iq`; in Claude Desktop it's `mcp__workiq-preview__ask_work_iq`. Call the exact prefixed name your host requires.

## Entity tool returns "not enabled" or "experimental feature disabled"

**Symptom:** Calls to `search_paths_work_iq`, `fetch_work_iq`, `get_schema_work_iq`, `create_entity_work_iq`, `update_entity_work_iq`, `delete_entity_work_iq`, `do_action_work_iq`, `call_function_work_iq`, `fetch_blob_work_iq`, or `upload_blob_work_iq` fail with an error indicating the feature is not enabled or is experimental.

**Cause:** Entity tools are gated behind an experimental flag in the WorkIQ CLI configuration.

**Fix:** Enable experimental features once per machine, then restart the Copilot CLI session:

```powershell
workiq config set experimental=true
```

After enabling, retry the original tool call.

## Entity tool returns a 400 / "bad request" on a Graph URL

**Symptom:** `fetch_work_iq` or another entity tool returns HTTP 400 with a parser or validation error.

**Cause:** URL formatting violates the entity tool URL rules.

**Fix:** Verify the URL:

1. Starts with `/me/...` or `/users/...` — no scheme, authority, or `/v1.0`.
2. All query parameter values are URL-encoded (spaces → `%20`, quotes → `%27`, etc.).

See the **URL Format Rules** section of `SKILL.md` for full examples.

## `ask_work_iq` is slow or appears to hang

**Symptom:** A single call to `ask_work_iq` takes 10–30 seconds.

**Cause:** Expected behavior. `ask_work_iq` is agentic — it performs multiple backend searches internally.

**Fix:** If you only need a literal list, filter, or known entity, use `fetch_work_iq` (or another entity tool) instead. Entity tools typically return in under a second.

## `ask_work_iq` times out around 300 seconds

**Symptom:** `ask_work_iq` fails with a timeout after ~300 seconds, or repeatedly hits the request time limit on complex questions.

**Cause:** The question is too broad and forces the WorkIQ agent to perform too many internal operations within a single call (e.g., "summarize everything everyone said about every project this month").

**Fix:** Break the question into smaller, more focused sub-questions and let the local model chain the results together. For example, instead of one mega-question, issue several scoped calls (one per person, project, or time window) and synthesize the answers locally. Each sub-question should be answerable in well under the 300s limit.

## Authentication or consent errors

**Symptom:** Tool calls fail with auth, consent, or permission errors.

**Cause:** The WorkIQ MCP server requires tenant admin consent on first use, and the current user must be signed in.

**Fix:** Direct the user to the [Tenant Administrator Enablement Guide](../../../../ADMIN-INSTRUCTIONS.md). For interactive sign-in issues, retry the tool call — the MCP server will prompt for sign-in if needed.

## Sign-in fails or hangs (brokered auth issues)

**Symptom:** Sign-in fails, hangs, or never completes — typically on Windows where WorkIQ first tries the OS authentication broker (WAM).

**Cause:** WorkIQ uses brokered authentication by default and automatically falls back to browser-based login if the broker fails. In some environments (e.g., misconfigured WAM, corporate policy, missing components) both paths can still fail or the broker can hang before the fallback kicks in.

**Fix:** Disable brokered auth so WorkIQ goes directly to browser-based login:

```powershell
workiq config set disableBrokeredAuth=true
```

Then retry the failing tool call or run `workiq auth consent` again.

## HTTP 403 Forbidden on an entity tool call

**Symptom:** `fetch_work_iq`, `do_action_work_iq`, or another entity tool returns `HTTP 403 Forbidden` for a Graph path (e.g., `/me/calendars`, `/me/events`, `/me/messages`).

**Cause:** The current user (or app) has not yet consented to the Microsoft Graph permission scopes needed for that path. By default, WorkIQ only requests a minimal set of scopes; additional scopes must be granted explicitly.

**Fix:** Run the `workiq auth consent` command to grant the required scopes, then retry the tool call. For example:

```powershell
# Grant calendar read access
workiq auth consent --scopes Calendars.Read

# Grant multiple scopes at once
workiq auth consent --scopes Mail.Read Calendars.ReadWrite Sites.Read.All
```
