# upload_blob_work_iq

Upload a local file to a WorkIQ path via HTTP PUT. Use this to upload files to OneDrive or SharePoint.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `targetUrl` | string | Yes | The target path for the upload (e.g., `/me/drive/root:/{filename}:/content`). Must be a relative path — do not include a base URL. |
| `filePath` | string | Yes | The absolute local file path to upload. |

## When to Use

- Uploading a file to OneDrive
- Uploading a file to a SharePoint document library
- Replacing the content of an existing file

## Path Conventions

| Action | Path pattern |
|--------|-------------|
| Upload to OneDrive root by filename | `/me/drive/root:/{filename}:/content` |
| Upload to a specific folder | `/me/drive/root:/{folder}/{filename}:/content` |
| Replace a file by item ID | `/me/drive/items/{id}/content` |
| Upload to SharePoint | `/drives/{driveId}/root:/{filename}:/content` |

## Gotchas

- **File size limit**: Simple PUT uploads work for files up to 4MB. For larger files, use the Graph large file upload session pattern (not currently supported directly — use `create_entity_work_iq` to initiate an upload session).
- The URL uses the Graph path-based format `root:/{path}:/content` — include the leading `/` before the filename.
